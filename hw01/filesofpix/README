Acknowledgments:
---------------
We received help from nearly all of the TAs (but special shoutout to Alan and
Kresten for helping us resolve some of our biggest bugs and finally getting
our images to display correctly)!

Implementation:
--------------
We have correctly implemented (to the best of our knowledge) readaline, 
including for lines over 1000 characters, separating digit from nondigit 
characters in a line, converting the original pixels to raw formatted 
characters, adding original pixels to a char array, and printing out the 
uncorrupted raw pgm to stdout.

Out of all of the given corrupted images, our program works for all but the 
turing image. We think this is due to an edge case related to null terminating
characters.

Time:
----
We spent around 55 hours on this assignment.
