Thank you to all the TA's for helping us: Rohun Nanda, Zane Ice, Tina Ma, Alan
Luc, Alec Xu, Neil Powers, Adam Rubinstein, Matt Zhou, Trevor Sullivan, Asli,
Cece Crumlish (and any others we may have missed)!


Architecture:
------------
We have two main modules, compress and decompress, both of which call the 3 
compression/decompression modules:
1. ppm_rgb which handles everything in rgb colorspace -- it can convert
        2D pixel arrays to and from integer representation and floating point 
        representation. It also handles trimming of the image, reading a
        given image that is to be compressed, and printing a decompressed image
        to standard output.
2. transform which handles converting pixel arrays from rgb color space to 
        component video color space. It also handles discrete cosine 
        transformations and quantization. The opposites of these compression 
        functions are handled here as well: a user can calculate chroma codes, 
        inverse discrete cosine, and convert back from component video color
        space to rgb color space.
3. codewords which handles converting from quantized pixel values to 32-bit
        codewords and vice versa. This uses our bitpack implementation to pack 
        and unpack the codewords.


Implementation:
--------------
To the best of our knowledge, we have implemented everything correctly. We have
tested the compression and decompression of images on many test images. 
Additionally, we have tested our bitpack implementation extensively with edge
cases such as very large numbers and widths of 0.

Time:
----
We spent approximately 13 hours analyzing the problems in the assignment.
We spent approximately 29 hours solving the problems after our analysis.
In total, we spent approximately 42 hours working on this assignment.
